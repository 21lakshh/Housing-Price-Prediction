## ZenML and Pipeline Automation

### What is ZenML?

[ZenML](https://zenml.io/) is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing machine learning pipelines. It ensures consistency across workflows and enables tracking and reproducibility of ML experiments.

### ZenML Pipeline Structure in This Project

This project follows a modular pipeline architecture with the following steps:

#### **Data Ingestion Step:**
- Reads raw housing data.
- Stores it in a structured format for further processing.

#### **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Step:**
- Handles missing values.
- Detects and manages outliers.
- Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical features.

#### **Feature Engineering Step:**
- Creates new meaningful features.
- Performs transformations like log scaling and polynomial features.

#### **Data Splitting Step:**
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

#### **Model Training Step:**
- Trains multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

#### **Model Evaluation Step:**
- Evaluates models based on metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
- Logs results for model comparison.

#### **Pipeline Orchestration:**
- The entire process is orchestrated using ZenML, ensuring each step is executed in the correct order.

## Running the Pipeline

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initialize ZenML
```bash
zenml init
```

### 3. Running the Pipeline
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

### 4. Visualizing the Pipeline
To track and visualize the pipeline execution:
```bash
zenml up --blocking
```
This will launch a ZenML dashboard where you can inspect pipeline runs, logs, and metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the pipeline, extensive EDA is conducted to understand the dataset:

- **Basic Data Inspection:** Checking dataset structure, data types, and summary statistics.
- **Missing Values Analysis:** Identifying and handling missing values.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of individual variables using histograms and boxplots.
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Correlation heatmaps and pairwise relationships between features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **ZenML** (for pipeline automation)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for ML models)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
